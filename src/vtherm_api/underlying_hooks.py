"""Underlying command hooks.

The Versatile Thermostat core sends commands to its underlying entities
(climate, switch, valve). This module defines three optional contracts that let
a feature manager provided by a plugin follow those commands, for example to
work around the quirks of a given device model.

The contracts are optional and independent. Each one lives in a dedicated
protocol next to the unchanged :class:`InterfaceFeatureManager`, like
:class:`InterfaceSetpointModifier`. A feature manager implements only the hooks
it needs and keeps satisfying :class:`InterfaceFeatureManager`; the core detects
each capability with ``hasattr`` on the method name.

The hooks are notifications: none of them modifies or cancels the command of
the core. A command can be changed by the dedicated contracts instead, such as
:class:`InterfaceValveWriteHook` in :mod:`vtherm_api.valve_write`.

Common rules:

* Each hook is optional and independent. A manager may implement only one.
* The core calls a hook only on a feature manager whose ``is_configured`` is
  True.
* Hooks are coroutines awaited by the core. They must return quickly: a long
  treatment (waiting, kick) must be scheduled with ``async_call_later`` or a
  task, without blocking the hook. The core cuts the call after
  ``UNDERLYING_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SEC`` seconds (10, exported by ``const.py``).
* An exception or a timeout is logged and never prevents the command of the
  core.
* A hook is called only if the command is really sent, by the core or, for a
  valve, by a plugin that took the write over through
  :class:`InterfaceValveWriteHook`. It is not called if the inhibition gate
  blocks the command, if the requested mode is already in place or if the load
  shedding refuses to switch on.
* New enum values can be added in a minor version (``RECALIBRATION`` came in
  0.10.0). A hook must accept a ``cause`` or a ``kind`` it does not know, for
  example by ignoring it, rather than fail on it.
* HVAC modes are passed as ``str``, like ``vtherm_hvac_mode`` in
  :class:`InterfaceThermostatRuntime`.

``async_before_underlying_hvac_mode``:

* Called just before ``climate.set_hvac_mode`` is sent to the underlying
  climate, while this one is still in ``current_hvac_mode``.
* ``command_cause`` is ``None`` for a regular command and
  ``"underlying_tracking"`` when the VTherm copies a change made on the device.
* For an ``over_climate`` with direct valve control going OFF, this hook is
  called before the OFF mode is sent, while the climate is still in
  ``current_hvac_mode``. The valve is closed afterwards, by the regulation,
  with a :class:`ValveCommand` whose ``cause`` is ``REGULATION`` and whose
  ``hvac_mode`` is ``"off"``. A plugin that needs to act before OFF must do it
  in this hook. This hook receives no command object: the target mode is its
  ``hvac_mode`` parameter (``"off"`` here), to be used instead of the Home
  Assistant state of the climate, which can still be on. ``command.hvac_mode``
  only exists on the :class:`ValveCommand` of ``async_after_valve_command``.

``async_after_valve_command``:

* Called after the opening and closing degrees have been sent to a
  ``valve_regulation`` underlying.
* It is also called when a plugin wrote the valve itself, through
  :class:`InterfaceValveWriteHook`: the command then holds the final value and
  ``written_by_plugin`` is True. ``requested_opening_degree`` holds the value
  computed by the core when the final value differs from it, otherwise None.
* Since 0.10.0, it is also called after each forced write of the valve
  recalibration, which did not call it in 0.9.0. A plugin that tracks the
  regulation must filter these commands on ``cause``. It is called with
  ``cause`` set to ``RECALIBRATION``. ``opening_degree`` and ``closing_degree``
  are the values forced on the entities (``closing_degree`` is None when the
  VTherm has no closing entity), ``percent_open`` is 100 for the full opening
  and 0 for the full closing, ``written_by_plugin`` is False and
  ``requested_opening_degree`` is None.
* The initial priming of unknown degrees does not call this hook.
* ``async_before_valve_write`` is not called for the recalibration: it must
  travel the whole stroke, so a plugin can neither change nor take over these
  writes. A plugin that owns a companion entity (for example a closing degree
  the VTherm does not drive) aligns it in this hook.

``async_on_underlying_power``:

* ``CYCLE_START``: at each cycle start, including the automatic restart
  (``is_repeat=True``). For a switch, one call per underlying with its
  ``start_offset_sec``.
* ``UPDATE``: at each valve update during a running cycle, even if the value
  does not change.
* ``STOP``: when a running cycle is cancelled (OFF, load shedding, shutdown).
  ``applied_on_percent`` is then 0.
* The on/off toggles of a switch during the cycle do not trigger a
  notification: a manager deduces them from ``cycle_start_monotonic``,
  ``start_offset_sec`` and ``on_time_sec`` (see below).
* The hook is called after the cycle start has been actuated, and the core
  awaits the managers one after the other, so a notification can reach a
  manager several seconds after the actuation. A manager must therefore use
  the timestamps of the command and never its reception time.
* ``cycle_start_monotonic`` is ``time.monotonic()`` at the start of the master
  cycle the command belongs to. It is ``None`` when no cycle is running: for
  a ``STOP`` (the cycle is over) and for an ``UPDATE`` emitted outside a cycle.
  ``monotonic`` is ``time.monotonic()`` when the notification is built.
* A switch turns on at ``cycle_start_monotonic + start_offset_sec`` and turns
  off ``on_time_sec`` later. The cycle is circular: when
  ``start_offset_sec + on_time_sec`` exceeds ``cycle_duration_sec``, the off
  time wraps to the beginning of the cycle. These times are nominal: the
  minimal activation and deactivation delays of the core can shift a toggle.
* This hook is distinct from :class:`AppliedCommandReceipt`: the receipt is for
  the algorithm plugin and describes the whole thermostat, this hook is for
  feature managers and describes each underlying.
